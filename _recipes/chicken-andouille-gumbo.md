Serves 12

## Ingredients

- 1 cup All-Purpose flour
- 3/4 cup Vegetable Oil
- 1 large onion (diced)
- 1 small onion (quartered)
- 6 celery stalks (diced)
- 1 large green bell pepper (diced)
- 3 cloves garlic (2 minced, 1 whole)
- 1 lb link Andouille sausage
- 4 Chicken leg quarters
- 4 qt water
- 4 bay leaves
- 1 tsp thyme
- 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning
- 1-2 cup frozen okra, sliced
- 1/4 cup fresh parsley, minced
- 6-8 eggs (optional)

## Directions

1. In a large pot, combine whole chicken leg quarters, water, quartered onion, Old Bay, 2 bay leaves and 1 whole clove garlic. Cover and bring to a low boil. Simmer stock until chicken is falling off the bone. Remove the chicken and set aside. Discard the onion, bay leaves, and garlic, reserving the liquid.
2. In a heavy saucepan, heat 1 Tbsp of the oil on medium high heat and brown the andouille until it is cooked through. Set aside sausage for later.
3. In the same saucepan, add and heat remaining oil. Slowly add flour 1-2 Tbsp at a time, stirring continuously. Continue cooking and stirring the roux until it is a dark brown (it should look like melted dark chocolate). Be careful to not to get the oil too hot or the flour will burn and you’ll have to start over.
4. Once roux has reached the correct color, add diced onion, celery, green pepper, and minced garlic. Cook until vegetables are very tender. Do not cover.
5. Slowly add 1 quart of chicken broth and bring to a low boil, stirring constantly.
6. Transfer roux mixture to a soup pot and bring to low boil. Do not cover, the roux will settle on the bottom of the pot and burn.
7. Add remaining chicken broth, bay leaves, and thyme. Simmer for 30 minutes.
8. While gumbo is simmering, debone and shred chicken and slice the andouille.
9. Add chicken and andouille to gumbo and return to a simmer. Simmer for 30-45 minutes.
10. Stir in frozen okra and parsley and bring to a rolling boil.
11. Optional: Crack one egg into a teacup and quickly pour into the boiling gumbo. Repeat with the other eggs being careful not to cluster them too closely. After all the eggs have risen back to the surface, reduce heat and simmer.
12. Correct seasoning with salt and pepper (red, white and/or black) if necessary.
13. Serve over rice with potato salad.
